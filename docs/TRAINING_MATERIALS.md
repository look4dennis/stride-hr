You'll see the login screen. Enter your email address in the first field - this is the email address your HR team provided. In the password field, enter your temporary password. Click 'Sign In'.

**Step 3: Password Change**
Since this is your first login, you'll be prompted to change your password. Choose a strong password with at least 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Enter your new password twice to confirm, then click 'Update Password'.

### Tutorial 2: Daily Attendance Management (7 minutes)

**Script:**

"In this tutorial, I'll show you how to manage your daily attendance in StrideHR.

**Understanding Attendance**
StrideHR tracks your work hours to ensure accurate payroll and compliance with company policies. Let's start with clocking in for the day.

**Step 1: Clocking In**
Navigate to the Attendance section from the main menu. Click on 'Clock In/Out'. You'll see your current status and a large 'Clock In' button. 

If your company uses location tracking, you'll need to allow location access when prompted. Click 'Allow' in your browser. The system will verify you're at an approved location.

Click 'Clock In' to start your workday. You'll see a confirmation message and your status will update to 'Clocked In' with the current time.

**Step 2: Managing Breaks**
When you take a break, it's important to log it. Click 'Start Break' and select the type of break - lunch, coffee, personal, etc. The system will start tracking your break time.

When you return from your break, click 'End Break'. The system calculates your break duration automatically.

**Step 3: Clocking Out**
At the end of your workday, return to the Clock In/Out page and click 'Clock Out'. Review your total hours for the day - this includes your work time minus any breaks.

Add any notes about your day if required by your company policy, then confirm your clock out.

**Step 4: Viewing Your Records**
To view your attendance history, go to 'My Records' in the Attendance section. You can filter by date range and see detailed information about each day.

**Step 5: Requesting Corrections**
If you notice an error in your attendance, click on the specific entry and select 'Request Correction'. Explain the issue and provide the correct information. Your manager will review and approve the correction.

**Mobile App Usage**
You can also use the StrideHR mobile app for attendance. The process is the same, but you'll have additional features like GPS verification and photo capture if required by your company.

Remember to clock in and out consistently to ensure accurate payroll and compliance with company policies."

### Tutorial 3: Leave Request Process (6 minutes)

**Script:**

"This tutorial will guide you through requesting leave in StrideHR.

**Step 1: Check Your Leave Balance**
Before requesting leave, let's check your available balance. Go to the Leave section and click on 'Leave Balance'. Here you can see your entitlement for different types of leave - annual leave, sick leave, personal leave, etc.

**Step 2: Submit a Leave Request**
Click on 'Request Leave' to start a new request. First, select the type of leave from the dropdown menu. Each type may have different rules and approval processes.

Use the calendar to select your start and end dates. If you're taking a half-day, check the 'Half Day' option and specify morning or afternoon.

In the reason field, provide a clear explanation for your leave. Some leave types may require specific reasons or documentation.

Add an emergency contact number where you can be reached if necessary.

**Step 3: Upload Supporting Documents**
If your leave requires documentation - like a medical certificate for sick leave - click 'Upload Documents' and select the files from your computer. Make sure files are in PDF, JPG, or PNG format and under 5MB.

**Step 4: Review and Submit**
Review all the information carefully. Check that your dates are correct and you have sufficient leave balance. Once you're satisfied, click 'Submit Request'.

**Step 5: Track Your Request**
Your request will now appear in 'My Requests' with a 'Pending' status. You'll receive email notifications when your manager reviews the request.

You can click on any request to see its current status and any comments from your manager.

**Step 6: Managing Approved Leave**
Once approved, your leave will appear in your calendar and be deducted from your balance. If you need to cancel approved leave, click on the request and select 'Cancel Request' - this may require manager approval depending on company policy.

**Emergency Leave**
For urgent situations, use the 'Emergency Request' option. This may be auto-approved for short periods, but you'll still need to provide documentation later.

Remember to plan your leave in advance and ensure adequate coverage for your responsibilities."
