# StrideHR Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the StrideHR production system. It provides step-by-step instructions for recovering from various failure scenarios and ensuring business continuity.

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours maximum downtime
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Critical Systems**: Database, API, Authentication
- **Non-Critical Systems**: Monitoring, Logging (can be restored later)

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

1. **Database Backups**
   - Full backup: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
   - Incremental backup: Every 6 hours
   - Retention: 30 days local, 90 days cloud storage
   - Location: `/backups/` and AWS S3

2. **Application Data Backups**
   - File uploads: Daily sync to S3
   - Configuration files: Version controlled in Git
   - SSL certificates: Stored in secure vault

3. **System Backups**
   - Docker images: Stored in container registry
   - Infrastructure as Code: Git repository
   - Monitoring configurations: Backed up weekly

### Backup Verification

- Automated integrity checks run daily
- Monthly restore tests to staging environment
- Quarterly full disaster recovery drills

## Disaster Scenarios and Recovery Procedures

### Scenario 1: Database Server Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Database connection errors
- API returning 500 errors
- Application unable to authenticate users

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)**
   ```powershell
   # Check database status
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps mysql
   
   # Check database logs
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs mysql
   
   # Attempt to restart database
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart mysql
   ```

2. **If Restart Fails (15-30 minutes)**
   ```powershell
   # Stop all services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   
   # Check disk space and system resources
   df -h
   free -m
   
   # Restore from latest backup
   ./scripts/restore-database.ps1 -BackupFile "backups/latest-full-backup.sql.gz"
   
   # Start services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Verification (30-45 minutes)**
   ```powershell
   # Test database connectivity
   mysql -h localhost -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD -e "SELECT 1"
   
   # Test API health
   curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/health
   
   # Test user authentication
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/login -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test"}'
   ```

### Scenario 2: Complete Server Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Server unreachable
- All services down
- Hardware failure or data center outage

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Immediate Response (0-30 minutes)**
   - Activate backup server or cloud instance
   - Update DNS records to point to backup server
   - Notify stakeholders of the incident

2. **System Restoration (30 minutes - 2 hours)**
   ```powershell
   # On new server, clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/stridehr.git
   cd stridehr
   
   # Copy environment configuration
   cp .env.production.template .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with production values
   
   # Copy SSL certificates
   mkdir -p docker/nginx/ssl
   # Copy certificates from secure storage
   
   # Restore database from cloud backup
   aws s3 cp s3://your-backup-bucket/latest-backup.sql.gz ./backups/
   ./scripts/restore-database.ps1 -BackupFile "backups/latest-backup.sql.gz"
   
   # Start all services
   ./scripts/deploy-production.ps1
   ```

3. **Data Synchronization (2-3 hours)**
   - Restore file uploads from S3
   - Verify data integrity
   - Update monitoring systems

4. **Final Verification (3-4 hours)**
   - Complete system health check
   - User acceptance testing
   - Performance verification

### Scenario 3: Data Corruption

**Symptoms:**
- Inconsistent data in application
- Database integrity errors
- User reports of missing or incorrect data

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)**
   ```powershell
   # Stop application to prevent further corruption
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop api frontend
   
   # Keep database running for investigation
   # Create immediate backup of current state
   ./scripts/backup-database.ps1 -BackupType full
   ```

2. **Assessment (15-45 minutes)**
   ```sql
   -- Check database integrity
   CHECK TABLE Users;
   CHECK TABLE Organizations;
   CHECK TABLE Employees;
   
   -- Identify corruption scope
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Organizations WHERE updated_at IS NULL;
   ```

3. **Recovery (45 minutes - 2 hours)**
   ```powershell
   # Restore from last known good backup
   ./scripts/restore-database.ps1 -BackupFile "backups/last-known-good-backup.sql.gz" -DropExisting $true
   
   # If partial corruption, restore specific tables
   mysql -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME < backups/specific-table-backup.sql
   ```

4. **Data Reconciliation (2-3 hours)**
   - Compare restored data with corrupted backup
   - Identify and manually restore recent changes
   - Verify business logic consistency

### Scenario 4: Security Breach

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized access detected
- Suspicious database activity
- Compromised user accounts

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)**
   ```powershell
   # Isolate the system
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   
   # Block all external access
   # Update firewall rules or security groups
   
   # Preserve evidence
   cp -r logs/ incident-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/
   ```

2. **Assessment (15 minutes - 1 hour)**
   - Analyze logs for breach scope
   - Identify compromised accounts
   - Determine data exposure

3. **System Hardening (1-2 hours)**
   ```powershell
   # Change all passwords and secrets
   # Update .env.production with new credentials
   
   # Rotate SSL certificates
   # Update JWT secret keys
   
   # Apply security patches
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
   ```

4. **Clean Restoration (2-4 hours)**
   ```powershell
   # Restore from backup before breach
   ./scripts/restore-database.ps1 -BackupFile "backups/pre-breach-backup.sql.gz"
   
   # Reset all user passwords
   # Force re-authentication for all users
   
   # Deploy with enhanced security
   ./scripts/deploy-production.ps1
   ```
